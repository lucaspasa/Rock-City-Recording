                    <p class="p1">Rock City road is a full service recording studio, capable of 
                        producing podcasts, or Voiceover work, up to a full  8 piece band. Our 18×40 live room
                         with 20 simultaneous live tracking channels is our centerpiece. We’ve designed it to be a 
                         truly, comfortable, casual open live room where a band can track live or work more 
                         contemporary if desired. Add in the high end microphones and preamps on hand, and 
                         imagine all that it placed in a beautiful country setting, on 10 parklike acres in 
                         the taconic range, and you will see why Rock City Road 
                        will become a true sanctuary destination for recording artists from all over the 
                        northeast and beyond. </p>

                        <h2>Our Owner</h2>
                         <div class="line"></div>
                        <p class="p2">Owner David Rinaldi’s vision stemmed from necessity, 
                            as he opened his home to engineering and recording many of the
                             musicians that he had made close friends over the years of playing
                              and recording music. However it was all done in the living room of 
                              his log cabin. While the results were great, and the logs proved to 
                              provide an acoustically desirable outcome, it became time to build a 
                              true live room separate from the family living quarters 
                              for obvious  reasons.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="sound paragraph-colomn">
                        <h2>Our Sound</h2>
                         <div class="line"></div>
                        <p class="p3">The live room is intentionally reverberant and not sterile. 
                            It’s been designed with the comfort of the artist/musician in mind, 
                            from headphone mixes to lighting, to heating and cooling systems.
                             While it is visually pleasing, it sounds very big and wet, yet in control. 
                             There are 2 isolation booths, 1 treated extensively for vocals and 
                            spoken word, as well as a 12×18 control room. 
                            Rock City Road has overnight accommodations available as a small 
                            green room/lounge can be converted into a studio apartment which can 
                            sleep up to 3. There are other other options available by request.</p>
